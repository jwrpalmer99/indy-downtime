## Indy Downtime Tracker

Indy Downtime Tracker is a Foundry VTT v13 module that lets you model downtime projects as structured, multi-phase progress. It supports multiple trackers, per-tracker tabs, configurable checks, and shared progress across selected actors.

### Highlights
- Multiple trackers, each with its own tab, phases, and progress state.
- Phase-based structure with auto-advance when a phase completes.
- Configurable checks, DCs, groups, and success/failure lines.
- Dependency graph and flow view for visualizing check relationships.
- GM-only settings dialogs (ApplicationV2) with export/import.
- Activity log + chat summaries for checks and phase completion.
- Per-tracker tab icons, interval labels, and optional DC hiding.
- Works with default DnD5e sheets, Tidy5e, and PF2e sheets.

### Quick Start
1. Enable the module.
2. Open `Game Settings` -> `Module Settings` -> `Indy Downtime Tracker Settings`.
3. Add a tracker and configure its phases.
4. Open a character sheet and use the tracker tab to roll checks.

### Common Workflows
- Configure phases and checks in the Phase Configuration dialog.
- Use the Flow View to set dependencies between checks and lines.
- Adjust progress or clean up the activity log in Progress State.
- Export/import settings or state for backups or transfers.
